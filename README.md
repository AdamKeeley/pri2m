TODO:

Well, everything really! But first thoughts:

- ~~Let's see if we can't establish a connection to test database and present a list of projects~~
- ~~Drill down into single project details~~
- ~~Get some more basic CRUD actions working on basic project details~~  
    - ~~Insert new record only when change made to current record~~  
    ~~[x] CREATE~~  
    ~~[x] READ~~  
    ~~[x] UPDATE~~  
    ~~[x] DELETE~~  
- ~~Look into html template inheritance~~  
- ~~Get things looking pretty, or at least usable~~  
- ~~Ability to search for projects~~  
- Add non-basic project details
    - ~~notes~~  
    - documents
    - platform
    - cost estimates/support commitments
    - kristal references
- Users and all that entails
- Transfer logging and asset register
- DSAs 
- Grants
- Authentication

Functionality will need to at least equal current Prism software before we can think about deploying and using it.
