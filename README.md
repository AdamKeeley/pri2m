TODO:

Well, everything really! But first thoughts:

- ~~Let's see if we can't establish a connection to test database and present a list of projects~~
- ~~Drill down into single project details~~
- Get some more basic CRUD actions working on basic project details  
    [] CREATE  
    [x] READ  
    [x] UPDATE  
    [x] DELETE  
- Look into html template inheritance
- Get things looking pretty, or at least usable
- Ability to search for projects 
- Add non-basic project details
    - notes
    - documents
    - platform
    - cost estimates/support commitments
    - kristal references
- Users and all that entails
- Transfer logging and asset register
- DSAs 
- Grants
- Authentication

Functionality will need to at least equal current Prism software before we can think about deploying and using it.
