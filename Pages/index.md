# Pri2m

This is my effort to reproduce the Prism application as a web app, for increased accessibility and function.

I don't know a great deal about the Django framework or web development more generally, so I'll be learning as I go. 

These GitHub pages will serve initially as a way to document that learning process and eventually (hopefully!) as a means to document the functionality and use of the web app.
